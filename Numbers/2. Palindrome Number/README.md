### Problem Statement: Palindrome Number

#### Description:
A palindrome number is a number that reads the same backward as forward. Write a Java program to determine whether a given integer is a palindrome number or not.

#### Requirements:
- The program should prompt the user to enter an integer.
- It should then determine whether the entered number is a palindrome or not.
- The program should handle both positive and negative integers.
- The program should handle single-digit numbers as palindromes.

### Example Input and Output

#### Test Case 1: Palindrome Number
**Input:**
```
Enter the number: 121
```
**Output:**
```
121 is a palindrome number.
```

#### Test Case 2: Not a Palindrome Number
**Input:**
```
Enter the number: 12345
```
**Output:**
```
12345 is not a palindrome number.
```

#### Test Case 3: Negative Palindrome Number
**Input:**
```
Enter the number: -121
```
**Output:**
```
-121 is not a palindrome number.
```

#### Test Case 4: Single Digit Number
**Input:**
```
Enter the number: 7
```
**Output:**
```
7 is a palindrome number.
```
